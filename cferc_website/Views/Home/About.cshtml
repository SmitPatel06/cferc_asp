                Dr. Cutler is a regional economist and econometrician who has focused his research on economic issues
                for the state of Colorado and for municipalities within the state. At the state level, Dr. Cutler has
                examined the economic impact of state transitioning away from coal generated electricity and to natural 
                gas. He has also examined the impact of the Colorado economy transitioning to a larger reliance on wind
                power as a source of electricity. Dr. Cutler has also examined changes in state tax policy which could 
                reduce income inequality and stimulate economic growth. At the municipality level, Dr. Cutler has 
                looked at the economic impact of tourism, the costs and benefits of economic growth, changes in sales 
                tax rates and the impact of Colorado State University in the local and state economy. 
            </p>

                National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Dr. Cutler’s work has aided these entities in doing policy 
                analysis.
